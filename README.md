# Bomb Game 
## Can you defuse the bombs before they explode?

## How To Play
* Earn points by draggin them into the defused bins (squares). 
* Be sure to drop the bombs in the bins with the same color 
* Bombs will explode when the fuse runs out
* Putting bombs in the wrong colored bins will also detonate them
* The game is over after 120 bombs have spawn
* Oh, and the bombs spawn more quickly the longer you play
